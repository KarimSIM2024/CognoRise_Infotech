## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

### Description:
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. The program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Features:
- **Random Number Generation**: The program generates a random number using Java's `Random` class.
- **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter their guess using the `Scanner` class.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The program provides feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- **Limited Attempts**: The user gets 5 attempts to guess the number. After that, the game ends.
